## Sum to Zero

Write a function that, given an integer N between 1 and 100, returns an array containing N unique integers that sum to 0. The function can return any such array.

### Example
```
Input: N = 4
Output: [1,0,-3,2] or [-2,1,-4,5]

Note: [1,-1,1,3] is incorrect because 1 occurs twice.
```

```
Input: N = 3
Output: [1,0,-1]
```

Note: There are many more correct answers, but your program should return any one solution.
